# competitive [![cptk](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=using&message=cptk&color=ffbb00)](https://github.com/RealA10N/cptk)

A collection of all of the competitive programming problems that I have solved 
(or attempted to solve, at least).

This repository is managed by [cptk](https://github.com/RealA10N/cptk),
a CLI that I've developed that keeps all my competitive programming files
organized, and automatically can download example test cases of problems,
run them to validate that your solution works, and even submit your solution
to the online judge without leaving the terminal.

## Statistics

This repository contains solutions to **18 different problems**.
My favorite competitive programming website is cses.fi, with
exactly 16 submissions
(88.89%
of total submissions).
